          <em>Registered Nurse, aspiring Web Developer</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a registered nurse from <a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm">New Hampshire</a> who is looking to make a change and follow my passion for web development.
          <br />My hobbies include cosplay, photography and cuddling with my kitten, Yui.
          <br /> I have been in the medical field for 6 long years and found myself always wondering what I could accomplish if I had gone into programming.
          <br />Unfortunately, as a female, I never thought that web development was something that I could do.
          <br />The household I was raised in set standards for what women can and cannot do as a career and for that I never saw programming as something I could really pursue.
